# Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict sales based on various features, such as store location, marketing strategies, and past sales performance. The goal is to build a model that accurately forecasts future sales, aiding in inventory management, financial planning, and business strategy.

## Features

- **Sales Prediction**: Uses historical data to predict future sales.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests for prediction.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared (RÂ²).
